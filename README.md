# RATFOR --- Rational Fortran

This repository tracks the history of the original C version of
the Bell Labs `ratfor` translator written by Brian Kernighan.

In this branch you have the earliest code, from the Sixth Edition
UNIX(tm) system.  Source code is in the `src` directory and documentation
is in the `doc` directory.  You can format the documentation with
`groff -C tmac.s rat | ps2pf - rat.pdf`.  This version of the documentation
is quite terse, only two pages.

I hope to take the latest version (from the Tenth Edition UNIX system)
and modernize it to run on current systems. We'll see if I succeed.
