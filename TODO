============================

Add tests. Coolest would be to use Software Tools Ratfor code

DONE:
=====

Change `return(x)' into `return x'
Go through to make sure there are spaces around all operators
Make any routines that are only called in one file static
See if any routines can be converted to return bool.
Look for `*p' as a condition and change to `*p != '\0''.
