============================

Make any routines that are only called in one file static
See if any routines can be converted to return bool.
Look for `*p' as a condition and change to `*p != '\0''.

Add tests. Coolest would be to use Software Tools Ratfor code

DONE:
=====

Change `return(x)' into `return x'
Go through to make sure there are spaces around all operators
